## Project file

The project file is a `JSON` file that contains the metadata of the project. The project file is used to link the different files of the project and to store the metadata of the project. The project file is a json file that contains the following fields:

- `project_accession` -> ProteomeXchange Identifier -> `string`
- `project_title` -> Project title -> `string` 
- `project_description` -> Project description -> `string`
- `project_sample_description` -> Sample description of the project -> `string` 
- `project_data_description` -> Data description of the project -> `string`
- `project_pubmed_id` -> PubMed identifier -> `string`
- `organism` -> List organism name -> `list[string]`
- `organism_part` -> List of organism part -> `list[string]`
- `disease` -> List of diseases -> `list[string]`
- `cell line` -> List of cell line (if available) -> `list[string]`
- `instrument` -> List of instrument names -> `list[string]`
- `enzyme` -> List of protease type for digest -> `list[string]`
- `experiment_type` -> List of all keywords in ProteomeXchange or PRIDE around the dataset. -> `list[string]`
- `acquisition_properties` -> List of key value pairs for the acquisition properties (see example below) -> `list[Key/Value]`
- `quantms_files` -> List of all files generated by quantms and collected in the final results folder-> `list[Key/Value]`
- `quantms_version` -> Version of quantms used to generate the files -> `string`
- `comments` -> List of comments or additional information needed -> `list[string]`


Key/Value pair object:

The key/value pairs are used to store the acquisition properties and the quantms files. The key/value pair object is a json object that contains the following fields:

- `key` -> Key of the pair -> `string`
- `value` -> Value of the pair -> `string`

Example of `acquisition_properties`:

```json
"acquisition_properties": [
     {"precursor tolerance": "0.05 Da"},
     {"dissociation method": "HCD"}
]
```

Example of `quantms_files`:

```json
"quantms_files": [
     {"protein_table": "protein_table.parquet"},
     {"peptide_table": "peptide_table.parquet"},
     {"psm_table": "psm_table.parquet"},
     {"feature_table": "feature_table.parquet"},
     {"differential_table": "differential_table.csv"},
     {"absolute_table": "absolute_table.csv"},
     {"sample_table": "projects.sdrf.tsv"}   
]
```

In the acquisition properties only the instrument and the enzyme are not present and should be written independently in the properties `instrument` and `enzyme`.

## Sample table

We only provide here the SDRF format used to analyze the data with quantms. The SDRF file is a tab-delimited file that contains the metadata of the samples. 
The SDRF file is used to link the different files of the project and to store the metadata of the samples.
