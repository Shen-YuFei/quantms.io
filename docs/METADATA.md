# Metadata Files


## Project file

The project file is a json file that contains the metadata of the project. The project file is used to link the different files of the project and to store the metadata of the project. 
The project file is a json file that contains the following fields:

- `project_accession` -> ProteomeXchange Identifier -> `string`
- `project_title` -> Project title -> `string` 
- `project_description` -> Project description -> `string`
- `project_sample_description` -> Sample description of the project -> `string` 
- `project_data_description` -> Data description of the project -> `string`
- `project_pubmed_id` -> PubMed identifier -> `string`
- `organism` -> List organism name -> `list[string]`
- `organism_part` -> List of organism part -> `list[string]`
- `disease` -> List of diseases -> `list[string]`
- `cell line` -> List of cell line (if available) -> `list[string]`
- `instrument` -> List of instrument names -> `list[string]`
- `enzyme` -> List of protease type for digest -> `list[string]`
- `experiment_type` -> List of all keywords in ProteomeXchange or PRIDE around the dataset. -> `list[string]`
- `acquisition_properties` -> List of key value pairs for the acquisition properies (see example below) -> `list[Object]`
- `quantms_files` -> List of all files generated by quantms and collected in the final results folder-> `list[string]`
- `quantms_version` -> Version of quantms used to generate the files -> `string`
- `comments` -> List of comments or additional information needed -> `list[string]`

Example of `acquisition_properties`:

```json
"acquisition_properties": [
     {"precursor tolerance": "0.05 Da"},
     {"dissociation method": "HCD"}
]
```

In the acquisition properties only the instrument and the enzyme are not present and should be written independently in the properties `instrument` and `enzyme`.

## Sample file

We only provide here the SDRF format used to analyze the data with quantms. The SDRF file is a tab-delimited file that contains the metadata of the samples. 
The SDRF file is used to link the different files of the project and to store the metadata of the samples.
