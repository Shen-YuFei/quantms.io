    "project_sample_description": "5\u03bcL of plasma was denatured in 50\u03bcl 8M Urea (Honeywell Research Chemicals), 100mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC, Honeywell Research Chemicals) and reduced with 5\u03bcL of 50mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma Aldrich) at 30oC for 1 hour. Followed by alkylation with 5\u03bcL of 100mM iodoacetamide (IAA, Sigma Aldrich) at 23oC for 30 minutes in the dark. The samples were diluted with 340\u03bcL of 100mM ABC and 220\u03bcL was added to trypsin solution (Promega) for protein digestion at a trypsin/protein ratio of 1/40 and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight (17h). Quenching of digestion was done by the addition of 25\u03bcL of 10% v/v formic acid (FA, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Rounds of solid phase extraction clean-up steps were performed with the use of C18 96-well plates (BioPureSPE Macro 96-Well, 100mg PROTO C18, The Nest Group) as described previously in Messner et al. 2020 24. Methanol (Fisher Chemicals), 50% v/v acetonitrile (ACN, Fisher Chemicals) or 0.1% v/v FA was used at each centrifugation step as required. After final elution, the collected peptide material was dried by a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf Concentrator Plus) and redissolved in 50\u03bcl 0.1% v/v FA, to be processed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.  1\u03bcg of protein digest (peptides) was injected and analysed on a nanoAcquity Liquid Chromatograph (Waters) coupled to a TripleTOF 6600 Mass Spectrometer (Sciex) at a flow-rate of 5\u00b5l/min. This was followed by a separation using a Waters HSS T3 column (150mm x 300\u00b5m, 1.8\u00b5m particles) in 20-minute non-linear gradients starting with 3% B up to 40% B (Buffer A: 0.1% v/v FA; Buffer B: ACN / 0.1% v/v FA). A data independent acquisition (DIA/SWATH) method was used, with MS1 scan from m/z 400 to m/z 1250 and 50ms accumulation time followed by 40 MS2 scans of 35ms accumulation time with variable precursor isolation width covering the mass range from m/z 400 to m/z 1250. Ion source gas 1 (nebulizer gas), ion source gas 2 (heater gas) and curtain gas were set to 30, 15 and 25 respectively. The source temperature was set to 450\u00b0C and the ion spray voltage to 5500V. Injections of samples took place in a random order.",
    "project_data_description": "The \u201cgas-phase fractionation\u201d methodology was used to generate the library out of pooled peptide digest of all plasma samples with the use of a LC-MS/MS method as mentioned before. 3\u03bcg of protein digest was separated with a 60-minute linear gradient (3% B to 40% B). Injections were performed at the mass ranges of: 400 \u2013 500 m/z, 495 \u2013 600 m/z, 595 \u2013 700 m/z, 695 \u2013 800 m/z, 795 \u2013 900 m/z, 895 \u2013 1000 m/z, 995 \u2013 1100 m/z, 1095 \u2013 1250 m/z. The precursor selection windows were 2 m/z (1 m/z overlap). DIA-NN 1.7.10 proteomics analysis software 35 was used for the library preparation with Mus musculus (mouse) UniProt (UniProt Consortium, 2019) isoform sequence database (UP000000589) to annotate the library. To quantify proteins, raw data acquired were processed with DIA-NN 1.7.10 with the \u201crobust LC (high precision)\u201d mode with MS2, MS1 and scan window size set to 20ppm, 12ppm and 8 respectively.",
