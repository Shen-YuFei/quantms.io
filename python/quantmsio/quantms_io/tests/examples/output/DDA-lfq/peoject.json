    "project_description": "The adult data set. The pathogenesis of multi-organ dysfunction associated with severe acute SARS-CoV-2 infection remains poorly understood. Endothelial damage and microvascular thrombosis have been identified as drivers of COVID-19 severity, yet the mechanisms underlying these processes remain elusive. A multiomics approach identified alterations in analytes associated with fluid shear stress-responsive pathways in critically ill COVID-19 adults as compared to non-COVID critically ill adults.",
    "project_sample_description": "150 \u00b5g of total protein was transferred to a low binding centrifuge tube and diluted with sodium deoxycholate to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) and 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, Thermofisher). The sample was then incubated at 60\u02daC for 30 minutes. After cooling for 5 min at room temperature, alkylation of the cysteines was initiated by the addition of iodoacetamide (SigmaAldrich) to a final concentration of 10 mM. This solution was incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at 37 \u02daC. The alkylation reaction was quenched by the addition of DL-dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma Aldrich) at a final concentration of 10 mM, followed by 30 minutes of incubation at 37\u02daC. From this reaction, 50 \u00b5g of total protein (~1/3 of the total) was removed and digested with TPCK treated trypsin (Sigma Aldrich) and Lys-C protease (Pierce) at an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:10 for trypsin and 1:20 for LysC. The digestion was left to proceed overnight at 37 \u02daC.  On the second day, samples were acidified with 10% TFA (Trifluoroacetic acid, ThermoFisher) to precipitate sodium deoxycholate and stop the proteolysis. Samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was then desalted using solid phase extraction HLB matrix (Oasis HLB \u00b5elution plate plate, 30\u00b5m) with 0.1% FA (Formic acid) for the first wash and 5% methanol 0.1% TFA for the second wash. Samples were eluted with 75%ACN (Acetonitrile)/0.1% FA, dried using a centrifugal vacuum evaporator (LabConco) and stored in the -20 \u00b0C.   400 ng \u00b5L-1  and 1 \u00b5g was injected directly on to an analytical Aurora C18 column (15 cm x 75 \u00b5m ID, 1.6 \u00b5m C18, Ionopticks, Australia) using an Easy-nLC 1200 UHPLC system (Thermo Fischer).  The column temperature was maintained at 60\u02daC with an integrated column oven equipped with a spray adaptor and larger chamber to accommodate the fittings of the column (Sonation, Biberach, Germany, PROSO-V1).  The samples were analyzed on an Eclipse Tribrid Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a FAIMS Pro source (Thermo Fisher). Data dependent LC-MS/MS was conducted at, the Spray voltage was set to 2-2.5 kV, FAIMS CV voltages of -50 and -70, RF funnel 40V, heated capillary 305 \u02daC. orbitrap operated at 120k(@200m/z) and Iontrap used for MS2",
